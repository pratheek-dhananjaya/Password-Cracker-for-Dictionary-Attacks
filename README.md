# Password Cracker for Dictionary Attacks

This script implements a password recovery mechanism by attempting to crack hashed passwords stored in a shadow file using multiple attack strategies. It first loads a predefined dictionary of potential passwords and extracts hashed credentials from the shadow file. Based on hash length, it identifies the hashing algorithm (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.) and systematically tests dictionary words to find matches. To enhance cracking effectiveness, the script employs additional techniques, including salted hashing, leetspeak transformations, and Caesar cipher shifts. Each password-cracking attempt is timed, and the overall execution duration is recorded. The results display the recovered passwords along with their corresponding users, making this script useful for security research and password auditing.
